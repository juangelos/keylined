An cool little app that gives you an instant command line and an open microphone to to be able to execute commands to use your computer.

Unnegotiable priorities:
- it needs to be instant and very, very fast: show the command line instantaneously when you press a key or invoke with voice
- it should rely on existing, FAST native mechanisms and APIs of the operating system to run commands
- it should be extensible by using operating system shell mechanisms, eg. add commands by having scripts, built-in commands, pipes, etc.
